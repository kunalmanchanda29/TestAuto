Automating test cases with Cypress and JavaScript 

1. Setup
   
Install Node.js: Cypress requires Node.js. Download and install it from the official website - https://node.js.org/download/release/v16.13.2/

Create a Project: Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it using the command line. 

Initialize npm: Run "npm init" 

Install Cypress: Run "npm install cypress --save-dev"


2. Open Cypress
Open Cypress: Execute "npx cypress open" to launch the Cypress Test Runner.

3. Create the Test File
Inside the cypress/e2e/ folder, create a new test file. Here I have automated and written TEST_FILE.spec.js

4. Run the Test
You can run the test in the Cypress Test Runner UI or headlessly
